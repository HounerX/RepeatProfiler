# Understanding the output---In-depth Tutorial
In this section, I will walk you through a sample output/outputs generated by the sample input data [here]. We will cover:

**What is in the output folder section**
- what each file means
 - How are the graphs generated and scaled
 - How is the phylip file generated

**How to get the most out of the tool**

 - How to find good repeat reference sequence if you donâ€™t have any based on your reads

 - How to use the phylip formatted file correctly and get the most out of the trees you generate.

 - How to get the most out of the tool and your data


## What is in the output folder
After running your data or sample data linked above, you will find this
folder in your current directory  or the directory you specified:

![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo_of_the_folder.PNG)

The time  refers to the  time you started the run. Opening, the folder you will find this

![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo2.PNG)

Here you can see your refrence name folder _outputn which contain all the analysis for this refrence We will get to that soon. This is done incase you run the analysis with multi-fasta sequence file. We also keep your refrences in single fasta files in Refrences_used folder.


Next thing you will find is ReadMe file.It will look something like this
![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo1.PNG)

This read me tell you what indexes that you will see later when we go to the the specific refrences _output file means.  In short, we refer to your reads paired or unpaired in an index. This makes it easier to name the files and manage output. Dont worry we convert it back to your read name when analyzing graphs and summary tables. This is just for the folders.  

One of the important outputs is the summary_final.csv table. It contains very useful info about the refrence length you used, average coverage for reads, percent coverage, etc. It look like this and as you notice we have the reads for you allowing  easy scanning  of the table.

![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo10.PNG)

As you can tell, each row represt the refrence and the read used, so if you had for example 4 pairs of reads/4 unpaired reads, you will have 4 rows with the same refrence name and each row will contain the corrsoponding attributes shown


Before going into the refrence_wide_color_scaled_graphs, lets go into a refrence _output folder and explain it then we will come back to this. It makes more sense this way.

Now the real features of the tool will show. Prepare haha!

Lets say we will go the first folder which is refrence named CL3_TR_1_x_53_0nt

You will find  the folder look like this

![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo3.PNG)

First thing you will notice is these sub folders. Each subfolder belong to the read/readpair this refrence sequence was run against. The indexes which we talked about earlier. We will go into the subfolders later.

Now, next thing you will notice  is combined_horizontal_colored.pdf file. It look something like this and it contains graphs as many as your read/readpairs. Now i will explain what does this graphs mean.

![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/phtoto6.PNG)


Each of these graph represent the coverage of the read/read pair when mapped to that  specfic refrence we opened its folder.  They are all based on a single color scale. That means by just quick looking at the graph you can tell which parts of the refrence sequence (refrence sequence base position is on x axis ) has the highest (red)/lowest(blue)  coverage. This  can tell you a lot about this read and refrence sequence. How/where this sequence enriched in that species reads compared to the other species reads. Color scaling accross different reads will help you in a great way to vizualize differences  among very large group of data.


Next pdf in the _output folder is the combined_variation plots.pdf
These plots has the variation(polymorphisim) in  among all the reads for this specific refrences. They have been put together for your convience to compare.


![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo7.PNG)


For example in this example you can see that sample 001 and 002 which are same species share huge common polymorphric base A  at the some postion this is shown by huge Red bar.

There are a a lot of more info in this plot than to just compare them by eye, so we will later explain the phylip file that we generate later, but before that  lets get back to the individual sample sub folders


Opening one of the sub folders  folders will look like this
![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo5.PNG)

it contain  the same plots we looked at earlier but indvidully. Keep in mind they are still scaled among all reads, so its main use is if you are interested in a specific graph you can simply its subfolder an get it. Also there is a solid colored version(not scaled) and a vertical colored scaled which is an alternative way to look at it, but most importantly you have the horizontal color scaled that you saw earlier and a text file that contains the information per every position in the refrence sequence. It contains the depth of every postion/mismatches of A/mismatches of T/mismatches of C//mismatches of G/.





Now  lets go back and check what is in the Phylip file and what does it mean  

![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo8.PNG)


Based on the variation plots explained earlier, we were able to capture phylogentic informative sites from these plots. We analysed each plot indivudaly and recored the bases that had high mis match coverage over 10% from the actual coverage. We also accounted for ambigous sites.

 This phylip files are most informative for long refrence sequences (1000+) bases. You can run this phylip file in your favorite tree software. We use iq-tree.

 The best way to use this is to run many tests and choose correct refrence sequence corrosponding on what you want to test out. We will have a full guide soon on how we got the most of out of this with many tests and examples and support why this way works if used the correct way.


 Back to _output folder, You will find a table called variation analysis.


 ![](https://github.com/johnssproul/RepeatProfiler/raw/master/pics_readme/photo9.PNG)




 This also captures its information from the graphs. It contain fraction of bases that didnt match for each read/read pair for this refrence. Looking at this table, can tell you which graphs have the most  phylogentic positions, and you can make decsions based on that.
